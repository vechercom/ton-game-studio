# TON Game Studio

This is a frontend for TON Game Studio, a platform for creating and publishing games on the TON blockchain.

## Project Overview
This project includes a smart contract (`game_platform.fc`) and a frontend to interact with it. The smart contract is written in FunC and compiled into `game_platform.fif`. The frontend is built using Vite and allows users to interact with the contract on the TON testnet.

## What I Am Testing
I am testing the deployment of the `game_platform.fif` smart contract on the TON testnet. The contract is designed to manage game-related functionality on the TON blockchain. I need testnet TON to deploy the contract and test its functionality through the frontend.

## Files
- `game_platform.fc`: The source code of the smart contract written in FunC.
- `game_platform.fif`: The compiled smart contract in Fift format, ready for deployment.
- `app.js`, `index.html`, `vite.config.js`: Frontend files for interacting with the contract.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies for the frontend.
